This was a project I made in class that involved peer programming and integration. I built the backend of this project and integrated another student's frontend. 
The backend of the project takes the songs.csv file (data retrieved from the Spotify API) and formats each row into a song object, each object is then stored in a red black tree
The backend also includes methods to filter songs by year, loudness, and to return the top 5 most danceable songs.
The frontend creates a text-based UI to use all the methods of the backend easily, the two can be used together by running app.java.
